Open Baton is an open source project providing a reference implementation of the NFVO and VNFM based on the ETSI [NFV MANO] specification. 

## Getting Started

Open Baton is implemented in java using the [spring.io] framework. For more details about the NFVO architecture, you can refer to the following page.

## install the latest NFVO version from the source code


The NFVO uses the AMQP protocol for communicating with the VNFMs. Therefore an implementation of it is necessary, we chose RabbitMQ. To facilitate the installation procedures we provide an installation procedure which will install the NFVO and the prerequired libraries. To execute the following command you need to have curl installed (see http://curl.haxx.se/).

To install the OpenBaton NFVO through its debian package you can type the following command:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSkL http://get.openbaton.org/bootstrap)
```

Please follow the documentation on [our website][http://openbaton.github.io/documentation/nfvo-installation/] for more information on how to configure and use it.
